# blendR

This is the GitHub repository to host the R code used to run the example in the paper *"Blended Survival Curves: A new Approach to Extrapolation for Time-to-Event Outcomes from Clinical Trials in Health Technology Assessment"*.

The example dataset is based on the CLL-8 trial data in NICE technology appraisal TA174 and a report `case_study_blend.html` in the `Scripts` folder explains how to perform the blending analysis step-by-step. In addition, the corresponding `Rmd` file is used to manipulate and restructure the information to produce the modelling and all R code from the Markdown document are extracted to the script `CODE_case_study.R`.
